- ui design
- simulation parameters
   - size, mass, initial velocity, initial spin, constraints?
- inclination of object's orbit - how to convey that easily
- is scale important?
- what calculations do we need?
- what would be the step size?
- define scope
- what would the presentation look like? what support materials would we need?

research needed
- types of stars
- variety of planet densities (mass/size)
- typical orbital distances
- existing games and what they do best/what is missing in them


why do objects start to spin?
 - if there are only two objects interacting from rest and they are symmetrical, they will not spin
 - they will spin if they are irregular - force applied on different parts of the objects is different due to difference in distance
 - if there are more than one, they will spin as they are guided by more than one force acting on each.
 - all planetary objects are formed of dust clouds - imagine them to be a large number of objects
   as they come together they miss one another and start going around each other colliding with other dust particles.
